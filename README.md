# Mini_Capstone

Advanced Tactics was my end-of-term project of second semester, built in Unity for Windows Phone and Android. 
It incorporated elements of gameplay, AI, networking/multiplayer and mobile development. 
Development was split between me and one partner, who created the AI, while I handled all UI and networking using Photon.

The game was inspired by tactical RPGs in the vein of Fire Emblem and Advance Wars, except catered to competitive online play.
